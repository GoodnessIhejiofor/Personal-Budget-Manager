# Personal-Budget-Manager

## Description: 

The Personal Budget Manager is a simple application that allows users to track their expenses and manage their budget. This project will challenge students to create a user-friendly interface where they can add, update, and visualize their spending in various categories.

## Features:

1. Add Expense: Users can input details about each expense, including the amount, date, and category.
2. View Expenses: Display a list of all expenses, which can be filtered by date and category.
3. Expense Summary: Provide a visual summary of expenses, such as a pie chart or bar graph, to show spending by category.
4. Budget Limits: Allow users to set budget limits for each category and show alerts when nearing the limit.

## Technical Requirements:

1. Components: Use functional components with hooks.
2. Props: Pass data and functions between components using props.
3. State Management: Use local state management with React's useState.
4. Reducers: Implement useReducer for handling complex state logic, especially for managing the list of expenses and budget limits.
